    <string name="tip_helmet">Helmet - Why wear a safety helmet ?. A safety helmet is one of the most important items of
        personal protective equipment used by motorcycle riders primarily to protect the head against impact.
        Helmets wont prevent accidents, but they clearly will cut down on death and injuries when collisions occur.
        Facts about helmet:It should not obstruct vision It should not impair with hearing It should be light weight It should not cause skin diseases.
        Kinds of helmet to be used:It should have a thick padding of thermo Cole- at least 20mm-which must extend to the sides of the head.
        A full face helmet is safer by all means. Components of helmets and their role:It should not increase the probability of neck injuries. The shell:
        The shell of a helmet is an injection molded thermoplastic or a pressure molded thermoset that is reinforced with glass fibers of made of fiber glass.\n
            1) It absorbs energy in an impact\n
            2) It distributes local forces from an impact\n
            3) It allows sliding on road surfaces\n
            4) It protects the face and temples\n
        The foam liner:This is a molding of polystyrene beads or polyurethane foam. It provides a stopping distance for the head.
        The foam can compress by 90% during an impact, although it recovers partially afterwards.
        But this helps increase the stopping distance thus reducing the peak deceleration of the head.
        It also protects as much as possible of the head. Proper strapping system:
        It is essential to wear a well-fitting helmet for the effective working of chinstrap system.
        To test if the helmet fits your head properly, tightly fasten the chinstrap and then pull helmet off forward by gripping the near and then pulling.
        The strap must be threaded correctly so that buckle locks the strap when it is pulled from the chin side.
        The strap must be pulled as tight as is bearable under the chin.
        Section 129 motor vehicles act?88 Wearing a protective headgear:Every person driving or riding otherwise than in a side car,
        on a motor cycle of any class or description, shall while in public place, war protective headgear conforming to
        the standards of bureau of Indian standards: Provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply to a
        person who is a Sikhs if he is, while driving or riding on the motorcycle, in a public place, wearing a turban:
        Provided further that the state government may, by such rules, provide for such expectations as it may think fit.
        Explanation ? protective headgear ? means a helmet which-By virtue of its shape, material and construction,
        could reasonably be expected to afford to the person driving or riding on a motorcycle a degree of protection
        from injury in the event of an accident; and is securely fastened to the head of the wearer by means of straps or other fastening provided on the headgear.

    <string name="tip_seat_belt">Seat Belt - SEAT BELTS: STAY SAFE AND SECURE:\n A seat belt or seat belt, sometimes called a safety belt,
    is a safety harness designed to secure the occupant of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result from a collision or a sudden stop.
    As part of an overall automobile passive safety system, seat belts are intended to reduce injuries by stopping the wearer from hitting hard interior elements of the vehicle,
    or other passengers (the so-called second impact), are in the correct position for the airbag to deploy and prevent the passenger from being thrown from the vehicle.
    Seat belts also absorb energy by being designed to stretch during any sudden deceleration, so that there is less speed differential between
    the passengers body and their vehicle interior, and also to spread the loading of impact on the passenger?s body.
        PROPER USE OF SEAT BELTS:\n
        1) Properly worn seat belt greatly increases your chances of surviving a motor vehicle collision.\n
            2) No doubling up ? only one person to a seat belt.\n
            3) A typical seat belt assembly consists of a lap and shoulder belt.
            The shoulder belt should be worn closely against the body and over the shoulder and across the chest,
            never under the arm. The lap belt should be firm against the body and low across the hips.\n
            4) Air bags do not take the place of a seat belt. When air bags activate during a motor vehicle collision,
    they reduce the forward movement of the upper torso and minimize impact. They do not prevent drivers and passengers from being thrown from the car.

    <string name="tip_speeding">Speeding - SPEEDING\nSpeeding is defined as exceeding the posted speed limit or driving too fast for
        conditions - is a factor in nearly one-third of all fatal crashes. Speed reduces the amount of available time needed to avoid a crash,
        increases the likelihood of crashing and increases the severity of a crash once it occurs.\n
        The public needs to be made more aware of the dangers of speeding. Crash risk increases as speed increases especially at road junctions and while
            overtaking - as road users underestimate this speed and overestimate the distance of an approaching vehicle. Further, in developing countries
        with a mixed traffic and high volume of vulnerable road users, increased speed has significantly contributed to an
        increasing trend of fatalities on Indian roads.\n
        Empirical evidence from speed studies has shown that an increase of one KM per hour in mean traffic speed typically results in a 3%
        increase in the incidence of injury crashes or an increase of 4% to 5% for fatal crashes. Speed has an exponentially detrimental effect on safety.
        As speed increase so do the number and severity of injuries. Studies show that the higher the impact speed the greater the likelihood of serious and
        fatal injuries.\n
        1) For car occupant, an increase in speed from 20 Kms to 100 Kms, the probability of fatal injuries increases from close to zero to almost 100%.\n
        2) The probability of serious injury for belted front seat occupants is three times as great at 48 km/hrs. and four times as great at 64 km/hr., compared with the risk at 32 km/hr.\n
        3) Pedestrians have a 90% chance of surviving car crashes at 30 km/hrs. Or below, but less than a 50% chance of surviving impacts at 45 km/hrs. or above.\n
        4) The probability of pedestrians being killed rises by a factor of 8 as the impact speed of the car increases from 30 km/hr. to 50 km/hr.\n
        Older pedestrians are even more physically vulnerable as speed increases. SPEEDING CAN BE A CAUSE OF SEVERE CRASH\n
        1) Drivers get lesser time to avoid mishap and the stopping distance lengthens which increases both the likelihood of crashing and the severity of the crashes.\n
        2) The vehicle structure is rendered incapable of withstanding the force of the crash which results in serious injury to the occupants.\n
        3) The protection capability of restraint systems such as airbags and safety belts and roadside hardware and safety features such as barriers and bridge rails become nullified.\n
        4) Vehicles become prone to increased tire tread wear, rise in tire weakening operation temperature, longer stopping distances and increased brake wear.\n
        5) At faster speeds the drivers ability to accurately see and judge the distances get compromised.\n
